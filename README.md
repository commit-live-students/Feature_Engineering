# Feature Engineering Project
Welcome to the Feature Engineering project. In this project, we will strengthen whatever we have learned so far in feature engineering course.

**In all above procedures we have used cleaned data or Pre-processed data.**

**Real-life data contains missing values, ouliers, and is less optimized.**

What we have learned in class so far:
* `Missing Value` - finding out the missing value from the dataset and Imputation of missing value
* `Outlier` - Outlier detection and methods to deal with outliers
* `Skewness` - Skewness treatment using transformation methods
* `Encoding` - Encoding of categorical data.

## Dataset
In this assignment you're going to be dealing with a familiar data set i.e. `NY Housing data`.

As we all know that this dataset contains 81 variables related to houses listed in NY and their `SalePrice`.
You will be given a subset of this dataset to perform few tasks and the whole (original) dataset for other tasks.
This will give you an idea about how techniques are related.

## Why this assignment?

* This assignment will help you to get familiar with primary and important steps of Pre-Processing and cleaning a dataset.
* We will learn why use specific techniques over other techniques.
* For this assignment you will be given following python packages:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - sklearn
    - scipy

By completing this project you will be awarded with 250 points.

So, let's get started!
